# Breast Cancer Data Analysis and Prediction  

## Overview  
This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling of breast cancer data. The primary objective is to classify cancer as malignant or benign by analyzing features extracted from cell nuclei. The dataset was thoroughly explored using various feature engineering techniques and visualizations, followed by the implementation of machine learning models for prediction.  

## Dataset  
The dataset contains attributes such as mean radius, texture, smoothness, and symmetry, which are extracted from digitized images of cell nuclei. These features serve as critical indicators in determining the type of cancer. Data cleaning and preparation were performed to ensure a high-quality analysis and robust model building.  

## Tools and Techniques  
- **Data Preprocessing and Manipulation:**  
  - Libraries: NumPy, pandas  
- **Visualization:**  
  - Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Feature Engineering:**  
  - Techniques to enhance predictive capabilities  
- **Machine Learning Models:**  
  - Random Forest  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- **Model Comparison:**  
  - Performance metrics were used to evaluate and compare the models.  

## Results  
The machine learning models were evaluated for their accuracy in classifying cancer types as malignant or benign.
